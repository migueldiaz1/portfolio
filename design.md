- **Background**: Off-white (#fafafa) - Clean, readable, modern
- **Text**: Charcoal (#2d3748) - High contrast, professional readability

### Typography
- **Display Font**: "Tiempos Headline" - Bold, editorial serif for headings and hero text
- **Body Font**: "Suisse Int'l" - Clean, modern sans-serif for readability
- **Code Font**: "JetBrains Mono" - Technical content and data visualization labels

### Visual Language
- **Academic Excellence**: Clean, structured layouts that reflect research rigor
- **Innovation Focus**: Modern interactions and subtle animations suggesting cutting-edge work
- **International Perspective**: Sophisticated color palette and typography reflecting global experience
- **Medical AI Theme**: Organic curves and neural network-inspired patterns in background elements

## Visual Effects & Styling

### Used Libraries
- **Anime.js**: Smooth micro-interactions, timeline animations, skill bar transitions
- **ECharts.js**: Professional data visualizations for skills radar and achievement charts
- **p5.js**: Generative background patterns inspired by neural networks and medical imaging
- **Splide.js**: Smooth project showcase carousels and image galleries
- **Shader-park**: Subtle background effects creating depth and movement

### Animation Strategy
- **Subtle Entrance**: Elements fade in with slight upward motion (16px translate)
- **Hover Interactions**: 3D tilt effects on project cards, color morphing on buttons
- **Scroll Animations**: Progressive reveal of timeline elements and skill visualizations
- **Micro-interactions**: Button state changes, form field focus effects, loading states

### Header Effect
- **Neural Network Visualization**: Animated connection nodes using p5.js
- **Gradient Overlay**: Subtle copper-to-sage gradient with low opacity
- **Parallax Elements**: Floating geometric shapes representing data points and research nodes
- **Responsive Particles**: Network visualization adapts to screen size and interaction

### Background Treatment
- **Consistent Base**: Off-white background maintained throughout all pages
- **Decorative Elements**: Subtle neural network patterns in header areas
- **Section Differentiation**: Slight tonal variations using sage and copper accents
- **Texture Layer**: Very subtle paper-like texture suggesting academic publications

### Interactive Elements
- **Project Cards**: Hover reveals additional information with smooth transitions
- **Timeline Nodes**: Pulsing animation indicating current position and achievements
- **Skill Visualizations**: Animated chart builds showing progression and competency levels
- **Contact Form**: Real-time validation with smooth error/success state transitions

### Mobile Considerations
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- **Simplified Animations**: Reduced motion on mobile for performance
- **Optimized Typography**: Responsive font scaling maintaining readability
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation for project galleries and timeline exploration

## Content Presentation

- **Professional Portrait**: High-quality image with subtle depth-of-field effect
- **Animated Headline**: Typewriter effect revealing name and specialization
- **Achievement Highlights**: Floating badges showing key accomplishments
- **Call-to-Action**: Prominent button leading to project showcase

### Project Showcase
- **Grid Layout**: Masonry-style arrangement with varying card heights
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Publication badges and awards prominently displayed
- **Technical Details**: Code snippets and methodology in expandable sections
- **Results Visualization**: Charts and metrics showing competition placements

### Skills Presentation
- **Radar Chart**: Multi-dimensional skill visualization with animation
- **Progress Indicators**: Linear bars showing proficiency levels
- **Category Grouping**: Organized by technical, research, and language skills
- **Timeline Context**: Skills positioned within educational journey timeline
